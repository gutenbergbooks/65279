<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this age of International Exhibitions, which,
when usefully directed, form what the newspapers
pleasantly call ‘a wholesome mania,’ it is well
to inquire into the causes, more or less urgent,
which call these undertakings into being—the
good they are expected by their promoters to
effect not only to the towns or countries in which
they are held, but to all the nationalities who
take part in them; and the probable results
of their success, if they are successful. It is
of course open to objectors to deny the soundness
of all these premises, and to question the
logical deduction of their usefulness, in the case
of all the projected Exhibitions which are brought
under their notice. And when—as is almost
necessarily the case—an appeal is made to the
pockets of the public in the initiatory stage of the
undertaking, objectors are not few in number,
and not particularly partial, or even moderate,
in the nature of their criticisms. Within due
bounds, indeed, it is well that it should be so.
Exhibitions got up mainly or entirely for the
purpose of advertising any particular branch of
trade, may be advantageous to that trade individually;
but the end and object is not so much
an harmonious and wholesome impetus to trade
and manufacture generally, as a rivalry more or
less rancorously conducted amongst the exhibitors.</p>

<p>The prospectus, classification, and other papers
relating to the proposed Forestry Exhibition to
be held in Edinburgh in the months of July,
August, and September 1884 are now before the
public; and it may be useful to inquire how
the idea was suggested, and whether or not it
is likely to be worked out with advantage to the
community at large.</p>

<p>The primary cause which appears to have called
forth the project has been no sudden or ephemeral
one. To grasp it rightly, we must go back for
at least a score of years, and carry our readers
with us to the government of our Eastern Empire.
There we shall find that a long course of unrestricted
spoliation and waste had denuded the
banks of rivers in proximity to the seaboard of
all their protecting vegetation. The river-sources,
far up in the inaccessible hills, had indeed been
safe from the inroads of the timber merchants,
and had been preserved from too rapid evaporation
by the virgin forests which surrounded them.
But in the low country the trees could be
easily cut and floated down to the coast during
the annual floods. A country deprived of its trees
is doomed to drought; and India soon began to
suffer from the reckless destruction of its forests.
The officials of the government, while fully aware
of the vast waste of capital and revenue going on
under their eyes, were quite unable successfully
to cope with it. They therefore delegated their
duties to subordinates, who in many ways winked
at, if they did not countenance the continuance
of the evils which they were supposed to counteract
and uproot. The absolute necessity of a
higher-paid and more capable class of officials,
whose duty should be confined to the conservancy
and replanting of the forests, forced upon the
government of India the formation of a Forest
Department.</p>

<p>But when it was sought to construct this
Department from the resources of Great Britain—the
natural nursery for Anglo-Indian officials—these
were found wholly inadequate; and
more humiliating still, there was not even the
means necessary to train efficient forest officers.
It was decided by the government, and tacitly
conceded by the public, that Great Britain
could not supply finished cadets for the Forest
Department of India. And from that day
to this, young men with a smattering of botany
have been packed off to the Forest seminaries of
France and Germany for the peculiar education
required.</p>

<p>It is not now our object to show how the
government of India has suffered in the interval
by the want of a proper system of forest training
in Great Britain. Waste and spoliation went on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">{194}</span>
of course, uncontrolled. But we think that the
<i>raison d’être</i> of a Forestry Exhibition will now
be tolerably apparent to at least the majority of
our readers. Indeed, the wonder is that Great
Britain has so long remained quiescent under the
implied reproach of neglecting what is not only
a useful but a profitable branch of estate management.
This reproach, which had long weighed
on the minds of all those who had the good of
the country at heart, at length found public
expression at the meetings of the principal
Societies of Scotland who represent the landed
interest of the country, and resolutions were
passed pledging their members to the support of
a Forestry Exhibition.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the great success of the Fisheries
Exhibition in London had induced the executive
Committee there to try and achieve for other
industries similar benefits to what they had conferred
on the fishermen of England. And they,
too, pitched upon forestry as a branch of science
well worthy of encouragement. But when it was
represented to them that the same idea, first
mooted in Scotland, had already assumed practical
shape there, they courteously gave way, and conceded
to Scotland the well-deserved right of
holding in her capital the first Forestry Exhibition
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Nearly all the foreign powers and the representatives
of our colonial and Indian empire are
to be found in the list of those who have joined
the undertaking as members. And the following
letter, which has been sent to our diplomatic
representatives abroad, rightly expresses the consensus
of official and public opinion on the merit
of the undertaking:</p>


<p class="center">(CIRCULAR-COMMERCIAL.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Foreign Office</span>, <i>October 27, 1883.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The attention of Her Majesty’s government
has been directed to a project for an International
Exhibition of Forestry to be held in Edinburgh
in the summer of 1884, the organisers of which
are desirous of securing the co-operation therein
of such foreign countries as the matter may concern.
There is reason to believe that the proposed
Exhibition, for which the necessary funds
have been guaranteed, will be influentially and
ably supported. The object is one which in the
opinion of Her Majesty’s government deserves
every encouragement, scientific forestry having
hitherto been much neglected in this country; and
I have therefore to request that you will bring
the Exhibition in question to the notice of the
government to which you are accredited, as being
one in which their participation might be attended
with advantage to both countries. I inclose for
communication to the proper quarters copies of
programme and other documents connected with
the proposed Exhibition, which have been supplied
by the Committee.</p>

<p>I am, with great truth, your most obedient
humble servant,</p>

<p><i>Signed</i> (for Earl Granville)</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Edmond Fitzmaurice.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>With this letter, we may fitly close the contemplation
of the causes which have led to the idea
of a Forestry Exhibition being held in Great
Britain. They are, in fact, briefly summed up in
the short but comprehensive dictum, which, we
fear, cannot be contradicted or gainsayed, ‘scientific
forestry having hitherto been much neglected
in this country.’ And the inverse of this proposition
leads us by no indirect steps to the consideration
of the good results which may be expected
to accrue from the Exhibition, if it is successfully
conducted.</p>

<p>To the capital of Scotland, a country lying
between the two great fields of the ‘lumbering’
interest of the world—the one in Northern
Europe, and the other on the continent of
America, the results, if only from the influx of
visitors, whether these are scientifically disposed
or otherwise, can hardly fail to be beneficial.
But there are wider interests involved. The
landed proprietor anxious to utilise his present
wastes and to make up for deficient rents by
profitable planting—the political economist inquiring
into new sources of revenue—the botanist
uncertain of the right names and uses of
some of his specimens of timber or of flowers—the
geologist, the sportsman, and the naturalist,
will find here a common ground of instruction
and amusement. For we may hope to see gathered
together the forest products of the world, carefully
examined and authentically named; the
various descriptions of machines used in different
countries for preparing timber for constructive
purposes; the timber slips placed on the hills,
the sluices, dams, and embankments formed on
the rivers for the transporting of wood by land
or by water; the mechanical appliances used for
moving growing trees, and the saw-mills for
cutting them into sections when felled. Here,
too, will be exhibited the various textile fabrics
manufactured from bark; materials for the making
of paper; tanning and dyeing substances; drugs
and spices; gums, resins, wood-oils and varnishes.
Another section will embrace botanical specimens,
fungi and lichens, forest entomology and natural
history; with fossil plants and the various trees
found in bogs.</p>

<p>The literature of the subject will be illustrated
by the Reports of Forest schools, the working
plans of plantations, which show the age of the
various woods on an estate, and the stage of
growth at which they may most profitably be
thinned or felled. Remarkable or historical trees
will be represented by paintings, photographs,
and drawings; and there will be sketches of the
usual forest operations.</p>

<p>Collections of forest produce, specially illustrating
the sources of supply, and the methods of
manufacture in different provinces, with accompanying
Reports, are solicited by the Committee.
And essays on all subjects touching on the value
of growing trees or timber are invited to competition
for prizes. Here, again, is opened a very
wide field of useful inquiry for all those interested
in the planting of woods in our own or foreign
countries; for the cultivators of cinchona and other
barks in our Crown colonies; for wood-engravers,
whose supply of hard wood for the purposes of
their trade is now very limited; for ship-builders,
anxious to get a substitute for teak, or to obtain
an increased supply of that most useful timber;
and for all who use wood or forest produce in
any of the many forms of manufacture in which
they are applied.</p>

<p>We may not enter into any further categorical
enumeration of the purposes and objects of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">{195}</span>
Forestry Exhibition of 1884; for, if the contemplation
of the great cause which primarily led to
the idea of the undertaking has brought us insensibly
to the enumeration of the good that may be
expected to accrue from its successful issue, it
seems needless to insist that the probable results
of that success will benefit the commercial interests
and the scientific knowledge of the world at large.
[Particulars of the Exhibition may be obtained
from Mr George Cadell, secretary, 3 George IV.
Bridge, Edinburgh.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.—PAVED WITH GOLD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not probable that Mr Hadleigh would
object to his son being endowed with a fortune
by a wealthy uncle, whatever might be his feelings
towards the donor. He would no doubt have
been ready with congratulations if the endowment
had come from any other quarter. As the case
stood, Philip anticipated some difficulty in reconciling
him to the arrangement, unless he should
succeed in making the two men forget and forgive
that old feud. However, there would be time
enough to consider these details after the consultation
with the solicitors.</p>

<p>He found Mr Hawkins and Mr Jackson together
in the senior partner’s room—a rare circumstance
for any client to find them so, for acting separately,
they might cancel or amend opinions after private
conference without loss of prestige. On the present
occasion Philip’s affairs had been the subject
of discussion.</p>

<p>‘Let me offer you my best congratulations, sir,’
said Mr Hawkins, a thin, grave-looking old gentleman
in speckless black broadcloth, and with
gold-mounted glasses on his prominent nose.</p>

<p>‘Accept the same from me, Mr Hadleigh,’
interjected Jackson. He was a sharp gentleman
of middle age, with small mutton-chop whiskers,
and dressed in the latest City fashion—for there
is a City fashion, designed apparently to combine
the elegance of the west end with a suggestion of
superhuman ‘cuteness.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, both. I must be a lucky fellow
when you say so.’</p>

<p>‘In the course of my experience,’ said Mr
Hawkins solemnly, ‘I have never known a young
man start in life under such favourable auspices.
We wish you success, and we believe you will
find it difficult to fail.’</p>

<p>‘It is wonderful what a fool can do,’ said Philip,
laughing; ‘but I will try not to fail. At present,
I am a little in the dark as to the terms of the
proposed arrangement, and Mr Shield referred
me to you for the particulars.’</p>

<p>‘The particulars are simple,’ the lawyer proceeded
slowly, as he turned over a number of
papers on which various notes were written. ‘In
the first place, I have great—very great—pleasure
in informing you that a sum of fifty thousand
pounds has been paid into your credit at the
Universal Bank; and a second sum of the same
amount will be at your command whenever you
may have occasion for it, provided Mr Shield
is satisfied with the manner in which you have
disposed of the first sum.’</p>

<p>‘This is scarcely the kind of arrangement I
expected. I had a notion that it was to be a
partnership,’ said Philip.</p>

<p>‘The arrangement is so simple and so complete,
Mr Hadleigh, that you will have no difficulty
in comprehending every detail presently.’ Mr
Hawkins went on leisurely, as if he enjoyed
prolonging the agreeable statement he had to
make. Mr Jackson nodded his head at the close
of every sentence, as if thereby indorsing it. ‘We
have often read in story-books of rich uncles
coming home to make all their friends comfortable.
You have the exceptional experience of
finding a rich uncle in reality—one who is
resolved to pave your way with gold, as I may
express it.’</p>

<p>‘But what does he want me to do with all
this money?’ asked Philip, desirous of bringing
the loquacious old gentleman to the point.</p>

<p>Mr Hawkins was not to be hurried. Like a
connoisseur with a glass of rare wine, he was
bent on making the most of it. Every symptom
of eagerness on Philip’s part added zest to the
palate; and he was graciously tolerant of his
client’s impatience.</p>

<p>‘As regards the partnership, that will come
afterwards. In the meantime, he desires you
to consider this handsome fortune as absolutely
at your own disposal. He imposes no conditions.
You are free to give up all thought of profession
or trade, and to live as you please on the income
of this capital, or on the capital itself, if you
are so inclined.’</p>

<p>‘That, of course, is nonsense. He must wish
me to do something.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly; and although he imposes no conditions,
he has expressed two wishes.’</p>

<p>‘And what are they?’</p>

<p>Mr Hawkins polished his eye-glasses and consulted
his notes. Mr Jackson nodded his head
pleasantly, as if he were saying: ‘Now it is
coming, you lucky dog.’</p>

<p>‘The first is,’ Mr Hawkins went on, ‘that you
should enter into commerce: the second is, that
you should take time to consider well in what
direction you will employ your capital and energy—time
to travel, if you are inclined, before deciding.
Then, when you have decided, he will find
whatever capital you may require beyond that
already at your command. But there is to be
no deed of partnership. You are to be prepared
to take the full responsibility of your own transactions.’</p>

<p>Philip was silent. It required time for the
mind to grasp the full meaning of this proposal.
That it was a magnificent one, he felt; indeed it
was the magnificence of it which perplexed him.
He was to be hoisted at once into a prominent
position in the commercial world, although he
was without experience of business, and was not
conscious of possessing any special aptitude for it.
His father knew him better than his uncle did,
and had declared him unfitted for commercial
pursuits.</p>

<p>He mentioned these objections to his uncle’s
plan; but the lawyers only smiled at the idea
of a man even thinking of such disqualifications
as obstacles to his own immediate gain.</p>

<p>‘I have known many men who were slow
enough to give away a fortune,’ said Mr Hawkins,
emphasising his words by rubbing his bald head
with the eye-glasses, as he gazed almost reproachfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">{196}</span>
at this singular young man; ‘but I never
before met a person who was slow to accept one.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay; but this position is a little curious.
You may set aside at once the project that I
should take the money and do nothing for it.
Mr Shield’s wish is sufficient to bind me to go
into trade of some sort; but in doing so, I
may make ducks and drakes of his gift in no
time.’</p>

<p>‘My dear sir, money always makes money if
it be guided with even moderate prudence; and
I give you credit for possessing that quality to a
sufficient degree.’</p>

<p>Philip bowed in acknowledgment of this good
opinion.</p>

<p>‘Besides, Mr Shield does not mean that you
should be set adrift without rudder or compass.
He will be always ready to advise; and I need
not say that you may always command our best
attention. Also he would expect you to appoint
some competent person as your manager, who
would be capable of directing the course of your
affairs.’</p>

<p>‘Ah—Wrentham would be the man, if we could
only make it worth his while to join me.’</p>

<p>‘We have no doubt, from what we know of Mr
Wrentham, that he would consider it much to his
advantage to undertake any charge with which
you may be disposed to intrust him.’</p>

<p>‘I must have time to think over it all,’ said
Philip, whilst a thousand visions were dancing
before his mind’s eye, like the dazzling spray of
sparks struck from iron at white-heat by a
blacksmith’s sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, certainly. It is especially mentioned
that you are to take whatever time you may
require to settle how you shall proceed. Mr
Shield is anxious to see you begin operations,
but he has no desire to hurry you.’</p>

<p>‘I will write to him as soon as I see my
way. I suppose this is all you have to tell me?’</p>

<p>‘There is only one other trifling matter. I
hope we have made you clearly understand that
Mr Shield does not insist upon anything. He
merely expresses a wish.’</p>

<p>‘And I have told you how I regard his wishes—as
fixed conditions of my being thought worthy
of all this generosity.’</p>

<p>‘He is emphatic in desiring that you shall not
regard them as conditions, but as mere indications
of what he would be most pleased to see
you do.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what is the remaining wish or condition?
It is all the same what we call it.’</p>

<p>‘It is, that in the event of your entering into
business, he would like you to remember how
much more freely and independently a man may
act when unshackled by domestic ties. In short,
he would like you to remain a bachelor for the
first two or three years, until you have firmly
established your position.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ exclaimed Philip in a soft crescendo
scale; whilst Mr Jackson nodded and grinned, as
if there were a good joke somewhere. ‘I cannot
promise that.’</p>

<p>‘No promise is required; and Mr Shield would
not consider it binding if you made it.’</p>

<p>‘I am not likely to make it,’ was the reply,
with a hesitating laugh; ‘but this may seriously
affect my decision.’</p>

<p>Mr Hawkins was unable to conceive any
possible decision except one, and was again gravely
effusive in his congratulations. Mr Jackson,
shaking hands with Philip at the door, expressed
his unqualified approval of the whole scheme in
one short phrase: ‘You <i>are</i> a lucky dog.’</p>

<p>Philip was not sure whether he was a lucky
dog or not. His uncle’s proposal was liberal and
generous beyond all expectation; but there was
something—he did not know what—about it that
was perplexing. Probably, it was the fact that
for the first time he was brought face to face
with the necessity of deciding promptly in what
course his whole future was to be directed.
Hitherto there had been no hurry; and at the
time when thoughts of Madge had brought him
to serious consideration of how he could most
rapidly win a position for her, the invitation
from his uncle had arrived. The final decision
was again postponed, as it was his duty to obey
that call for his mother’s sake.</p>

<p>Now his future had been decided for him;
and the prospect was in every way a tempting
one. There would have been no hesitation on
his part, but for the strange position which his
father and Mr Shield occupied towards each
other. The question Philip had first to settle
with himself was, how he should act in order
to bring about a reconciliation between them.
He knew that if he could accomplish this, he
would fulfil his mother’s dearest wish—an object
nearer his heart than even the possession of a
fortune.</p>

<p>As for business, although he had no special
inclination for it, he did not dislike it. He had
heard and read of millionaires—their struggles
and victories, as desperate and as glorious as any
recorded in the history of battlefields. Life and
honour were as much at stake in doing the daily
work of the world as in shooting down the foes
of the nation or the foes of the nation’s policy.
Our merchants, our inventors, our educators, our
labourers, were the true soldiers, and their
victories were the enduring ones. There was
the great enemy of mankind, Poverty, with his
attendant demons Ignorance and Laziness, still
to conquer; and there were legions of starving
people crying out to be led against him. Vast
territories lay untilled, vast resources of earth,
air, and water still unused, to be called forth to
content and enrich the hungry and poor. What
noble work there was for men to do who had
sufficient capital at command!</p>

<p>He had never before speculated upon such a
career. Now that it was presented to him, his
imagination was stirred by thoughts of the great
deeds that were yet to be done to bless humanity
and ennoble life.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> intense interest with which all eyes have
been turned upon the Soudan—that is, Country
of the Blacks, or Negroland—gives a special value
now to any information about that region, particularly
if it refer to such towns as Khartoum,
or that named at the head of this paper. The
former place has been pretty fully described of
late in the newspapers, while little has been told
us of the latter beyond actual war-news. This is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">{197}</span>
the greater pity, as Suakim possesses a good deal
of historical interest, and Khartoum does not.</p>

<p>Suakim—the word is spelt in a variety of ways—is
not only one of the most important towns of
Nubia, but the chief port of the Soudan and of
the whole western coast of the Red Sea. It came
into the possession of Egypt in 1865 by cession or
purchase from Turkey—along with Massowah
and one or two other towns and the districts
around them—and now appears to be regarded
by the British government and every one else as an
integral part of the Egyptian dominions. Similar
subjection of Suakim to Egypt, as we shall presently
see, existed in very remote times. The
town proper lies on a small island about eight
miles and three-quarters in diameter—almost as
long as the little bay in which it is placed, a mere
tongue of water separating it from the mainland.</p>

<p>Crossing the inlet southwards to the mainland,
we step into the large suburb called El Gêf, with
a much larger population than the insular town,
very irregular streets, and the houses mere native
(Bishareen) huts. There is also a very lively
bazaar, and, in the north-west of the place, the
barracks, one section of which, a few years ago,
was armed with three pieces of cannon. In the
outskirts are the wells—surrounded by gardens
and date plantations—which supply the people
with drinking-water, although, from the nearness
of the wells to the sea, this is brackish, and would
scarcely be considered palatable by foreign troops.
El Gêf is really an oasis; all round it, save seawards,
extend many miles of salt and arid wilderness.
Indeed, the whole distance from Suakim
to Berber—two hundred and eighty miles inland—is
for the most part desert, the route garnished
here and there with wells of water and encampments
of the wandering Bishareen, who, with the
Haddendowa, a similar set of people, possess the
whole wilderness from east of the first cataract of
the Nile up to Kassala and the boundaries of
Abyssinia. These tribes, though sometimes called
Bedouin, whom in many respects they resemble,
are really a very different people. Bedouin
proper are Arabs of the Semitic, while the
Bishareen are of the Hamitic family.</p>

<p>The chief articles of export are cotton, gum-arabic,
cattle, hides, butter, tamarinds, senna
leaves, and ivory. The imports consist of cotton
goods, iron, wood, carpets, weapons, steel, and
fancy wares. Berber in the east, and Kassala
in the south, are the great centres for all the
caravan traffic of Suakim, which is also the port
on the one side for the whole Soudan—an inland
country as large as India—and on the other side,
for Arabia. Hence it is much visited by Mohammedan
pilgrims to Mecca, their port of Jeddah
occupying a corresponding position on the Arabian
to that which Suakim does on the African coast.
Twenty years ago, from three to four thousand
slaves per annum were shipped from here to
Jeddah, and though this monstrous traffic has
been much crippled of late years by the Egyptian
government, out of regard for English feeling, it is
to be feared that it is not yet extinct. Oddly
enough, Hassan Mousa Akad, one of the ringleaders
in Arabi’s recent rebellion, and the greatest
slave-merchant in Egypt, was exiled to this very
slave-port of Suakim, hence his complicity
in the Soudan disturbances is not unnaturally
suspected. The total population of the town and
suburb is estimated by Schweinfurth—one of our
greatest authorities—at from eleven to thirteen
thousand. The port is now in regular communication
with Suez by steamer—four days’ journey—and
with Europe by telegraph. The Egyptian
governor (Mudeer) and vice-governor (Wakeel)
live at Suakim, and the budget for the district
in 1882 was—income, £25,945; expenditure,
£20,492—thus being one of the few districts of
the Soudan which yielded a surplus.</p>

<p>In ancient times, the whole of what we may
call the Suakim seaboard—extending northwards
along the coast as far as a line drawn
from the first cataract, and southwards as far
even as Bab-el-Mandeb—was known as the
Troglodyte country. The Troglodytes, as the
name implies, dwelt in caves, were by occupation
herdsmen, and often uncivilised and wretched in
the extreme. A graphic picture of the hard life
of another Troglodyte people, dwelling in the
rocky fastnesses east of Jordan, is preserved for
us in the thirtieth chapter of the book of Job.
‘For want and famine,’ it says, ‘they are solitary;
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate
and waste. Who cut up mallows by the bushes,
and juniper roots for their meat. They were
driven forth of men (who cried after them as
after a thief), to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys,
in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.’</p>

<p>Perhaps the Troglodytes of the Nubian shore
were a superior stock of their kind; at anyrate,
they appear to have been impressed into the army
of the ancient Pharaohs, and to have shared in the
first invasion of the kingdom of Judah, and the
first spoliation of Solomon’s Temple. The name
of the Pharaoh of that time was Shishak, and
two accounts of his expedition have come down
to us: one is in the historical books of Scripture
(2 Chronicles, xii., also 1 Kings, xiv.); and the
other, remarkably enough, is by Shishak himself.
That of the Egyptian king is contained in the
famous hieroglyphic inscription on the walls of
the temple of Karnak at Thebes, in Upper
Egypt, a great part of which is still legible, after
the lapse of nearly three thousand years! The
book of Chronicles tells us with what an immense
army of charioteers, cavalry, and infantry, Shishak
overran Judea. He marched against it
‘with twelve hundred chariots, and threescore
thousand horsemen: and the people were without
number that came with him out of Egypt;
the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.’
Of these three allies, the first are probably the
Libyans (as in Daniel, xi. 43), and the last the
same as the modern Abyssinians. For the middle
name of ‘Sukkiims,’ the old Greek translation
of the Bible—made by Jews a century or two
before the birth of Christ—substitutes the word
<i>Troglodytes</i>, the very people of the Nubian coast
whom we have been considering, and who are
now known as Bishareen. But yet more, Pliny
the elder, an old Latin writer, who died <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
79, mentions, in his enumeration of places on this
Troglodyte coast, a town called Suche, which,
according to the general opinion of scholars, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">{198}</span>
identical with the modern port of Suakim, at
present (while we write) governed by an English
admiral, and its fortifications manned by British
sailors and marines.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MISS_MARRABLES_ELOPEMENT">MISS MARRABLE’S ELOPEMENT.</h2>
</div>


<h3 title="CHAPTER II.">IN TWO CHAPTERS—CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Marrable</span>, who, when she received this
love-letter, was sitting in her bedroom, was
thunderstruck. At first, she thought of going to
Amy and charging her with baseness and ingratitude;
but after some reflection, she decided to let
matters, for the time at least, take their course,
and to confound the schemes of the rash couple
by means of a grand stroke at the final moment.
She went, however, at once to Lucy, in whom,
as I have said, she had great confidence, and told
her all.</p>

<p>‘How foolish of her,’ said Lucy.</p>

<p>‘Yes, my dear! how foolish, and how wicked!’
assented Miss Marrable. ‘I feel it my duty to
prevent the carrying out of this mad plan, and
also to make Amy suffer for her folly. I shall
therefore send her this letter; and allow the
hare-brained pair to mature their schemes.—And
what, Lucy dear, do you think that I propose to
do? You will never guess. Listen! Amy and I
are of much the same height. I shall personate
her by concealing—ahem—my face, and drive
away with this vile young man; and then, when
he believes that he has left me far behind, I shall
overwhelm him with shame and confusion.’</p>

<p>Lucy could not help laughing. ‘That would
really be good fun, aunt,’ she said. ‘Yes, send
the letter to Amy; and by all means let matters
take their course for the present.’</p>

<p>Miss Marrable did send the letter; and
Amy duly received it, unsuspectingly; but five
minutes later, Lucy revealed the whole plot to
her, and threw her into the deepest trepidation.</p>

<p>Here, however, Lucy’s superior coolness came
in most usefully. ‘You need not despair,’ said
the elder cousin. ‘If aunt thinks of having fun
with you and Mr Jellicoe, why not turn the
tables, and have fun with her? You must find
some other way of carrying on your correspondence;
but at the same time answer this
letter by the old medium. Your answer will of
course fall into aunt’s hands. You must mislead
her, and then’——</p>

<p>‘But,’ objected Amy, ‘how am I to make
matters turn out properly?’</p>

<p>‘Listen!’ said Lucy. ‘Aunt proposes to personate
you. Very well. Put off the time of
your elopement, say, for half an hour; and meantime
Mr Jellicoe must find some one to personate
him. My idea is for aunt to elope with the
billiard-marker, and so give you time to get away.
Do you see?’</p>

<p>Amy could not at first grasp the significance
of this bold proposition; but when she succeeded
in doing so, she was delighted with it.</p>

<p>‘I shall tell Mr Rhodes,’ said Lucy, when she
had sufficiently explained the plan; ‘for I know
that he will gladly help you; and Mr Jellicoe
can talk it all over with him and have the benefit
of his advice.’</p>

<p>‘But what will aunt say when she discovers
how we—how you—have deceived her?’ asked
Amy.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Lucy slily, ‘I must talk about that
too with Mr Rhodes. But never fear!’ And she
went off to rejoin Miss Marrable, who was still
much flurried.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Lucy met Robert on the
beach, and told him what had happened. ‘And
now,’ she said in conclusion, ‘I am going to make
a dreadful proposition to you. We must also
elope together!’</p>

<p>‘I am sure I don’t mind,’ said Mr Rhodes.
‘After hearing your news, I was going to propose
as much myself. It would take you out of the
reach of your aunt’s reproaches, when she finds
out the trick that has been played upon her.’</p>

<p>‘You are a dear old love!’ cried Lucy with
enthusiasm. ‘I wouldn’t for the world have
Amy made unhappy; and I feel that I must help
her, although I don’t approve of elopements.
Now go and talk to Mr Jellicoe; and don’t forget
to have the licenses ready. Perhaps Mr Jellicoe
can arrange for both Amy and me to sleep that
night with the Joneses, whoever they may be;
or perhaps, after all, we had better not go there,
since aunt knows of that part of the scheme.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay,’ said Robert, ‘that I can arrange for
both of you to sleep at the Browns at Llanyltid.
They have a large house, and, curiously enough,
my sister Dora, whom you have often met in town,
is staying there with them; so you will have a
companion and sympathiser. And now I will go
and talk to Jellicoe.’</p>

<p>I need not follow in detail the progress of the
new scheme of double elopement. Suffice it to
say that the bogus correspondence destined to
mislead Miss Marrable, was steadily kept up;
that Amy and Vivian found other means of safely
communicating with one another; that the
Browns were written to; that the licenses were
obtained; that three carriages-and-pairs were
engaged, one to call at the hotel at nine o’clock
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and two at half-past; that coachmen were
liberally feed; and finally, that the billiard-marker
at the <i>Cors-y-Gedol</i>, a spruce young fellow
of some education, was bribed, at considerable
cost, to personate Vivian Jellicoe and to run away
with Miss Marrable.</p>

<p>At length, Wednesday morning arrived; and
with it came the last of the billet-doux that were
to fall into the cunning spinster’s hands. One of
them had been composed by Vivian and Robert,
and written by the former on pink paper, folded
billet-doux-wise. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My own Amy</span>—I have satisfactorily arranged
everything. The carriage will be at the door of
the hotel at nine o’clock. I shall not show
myself, for your aunt may be about. Be careful,
therefore, to avoid her; and enter the carriage as
quickly as possible. In order that there may be
no mistake, I have told the driver to wear a
white choker round his neck. I hope that you
will be punctual. Everything depends upon punctuality.
Till nine o’clock, good-bye.—Your most
devoted</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Vivian</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Marrable, after reading this note, refolded
it as usual, and took care that it reached
Amy. Then, with the consciousness that she
was about to perpetrate a great and good action,
she sat down in her own room, and waited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">{199}</span>
Amy’s reply to be brought to her by the treacherous
maid. The note, which was very brief, came
to Miss Marrable in less than half an hour.
‘<span class="smcap">Dear Viv</span>,’ wrote Amy, ‘I will be ready, and
will look out for the white choker.—Your
loving A.’</p>

<p>In spite of the ordeal which was before her,
the good old spinster was perfectly calm and
unflurried. At one o’clock she made a very
hearty luncheon; at half-past two she took her
nieces for a walk, and talked to them with extraordinary
affability about the emancipation of
women; and at half-past six she appeared at the
<i>table d’hôte</i>, and, just as if the occasion were an
ordinary one, complained of the soup being too
peppery, the fish too cold, and the mutton too
underdone. Her coolness was admirable. Lucy
and Amy, on the other hand, could scarcely conceal
their excitement and agitation. They each
looked at least a hundred times during dinner
at the clock upon the mantel-piece; and they
each started and turned red whenever the noise
of carriage-wheels without was heard. After
dinner, Miss Marrable went again to her room
and began to make her preparations.</p>

<p>‘How sad it will be,’ she thought to herself,
‘for poor young Jellicoe when I discover myself
and overwhelm him with reproaches. Men are
but poor creatures. Perhaps he will faint. Yes;
I will take my salts-bottle.’ She wrapped herself
in an ulster belonging to Amy, and having
shrouded her face in a thick veil, took a seat at
her window, which happened to be immediately
above the front-door of the hotel.</p>

<p>Meantime, Edward Griffiths the billiard-marker
was ill at ease. He knew Miss Marrable by sight,
and looked forward with terror to the prospect
of an encounter with her at close quarters.
Nevertheless, he had Vivian Jellicoe’s five-pound
note in his pocket, and he was determined to see
the affair bravely through. He felt, however,
that his natural bravery would not be sufficient
to support him; and he therefore, at about six
o’clock, began to swallow a succession of potent
doses of whisky-and-water, with the object of
laying in a stock of Dutch courage. Whether the
whisky was bad or the water was too powerful,
I cannot say; but at ten minutes to nine, when
Vivian Jellicoe arrived to give final directions
and counsel to his substitute, he found Edward
Griffiths decidedly the worse for liquor. Fortunately
the young fellow was neither quarrelsome
nor noisy in his cups. His main ambition seemed
to be to go to sleep in peace; and no sooner had
Vivian bundled him into one corner of the
carriage, which was in waiting in the stable-yard,
than Mr Griffiths incontinently slumbered. The
carriage was then driven round to the front-door
of the hotel. Miss Marrable, from her post of
vantage, saw it, and, remarking that the coachman
wore a white choker, descended at once, and
listened, as she went, outside Amy’s room, to
satisfy herself that that young lady had not
forestalled her. The porter with alacrity opened
the carriage-door. In the dark shadows of the
interior, Miss Marrable caught sight of the figure
of a man; and making sure that all was right,
she entered at once. An instant later she was being
whirled northward along the lonely Harlech Road.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards, two other carriages
left the hotel, but in the opposite direction. In
one of them were Lucy and Mr Rhodes; and
in the other, Amy and Mr Jellicoe. It was nearly
midnight ere they arrived at the Browns’ house
at Llanyltid; but the Browns were all up and
waiting for them, and the two runaway couples
were warmly welcomed, and hospitably taken
care of.</p>

<p>Miss Marrable was less fortunate. As soon
as the carriage in which she sat had been driven
beyond the lights of the town, she threw aside
her veil, and gazed with magnificent scorn towards
the dim form upon the seat in front of her. The
look eliciting no response of any kind, Miss
Marrable ventured to cough, at first gently, and
then with considerable violence; but still the
figure took no notice.</p>

<p>‘This is exceedingly strange,’ thought the
spinster lady. ‘I must adopt more active measures.’
And with great tenderness, she prodded
Mr Griffiths with the point of her umbrella.
The billiard-marker groaned in his sleep. ‘Mr
Jellicoe!’ she exclaimed in her deepest and
most threatening tones. She had counted upon
this exclamation producing an instantaneous and
astonishing effect upon her companion; and
she was wofully disappointed when he merely
groaned again.</p>

<p>‘Gracious!’ she said to herself: ‘he is ill.
He would never go on like that, if he were not
ill. The fright has been too much for him. Oh,
how sorry I am! These men are such weak
creatures. I must stop the carriage!’ And,
throwing down the sash of the window, she put
out her head and cried to the driver to pull up
his horses. But the driver, like the billiard-marker,
had been very liberally feed; and he was
determined that nothing should stop him until
he reached Harlech; he therefore cracked his
whip, to drown Miss Marrable’s voice, and drove
down the next hill at a pace which threatened to
shake the carriage to pieces.</p>

<p>‘Stop, stop! For goodness’ sake, stop!’ shouted
Miss Marrable; but finding that her words were
not listened to, she drew in her head, and strove
to revive the wretched man in front of her. She
held her salts-bottle to his nose; she chafed
his hands; she fanned his brow; and she allowed
his feverish head to rest upon her shoulder; but
she could not awaken him.</p>

<p>‘If he should die!’ she thought. ‘I intended
to frighten him; but not so much as this. Oh!
this is terrible!’ And once more she tried to prevail
upon the driver to stop; but in vain. The
sight of distant lights, however, gave her at length
some satisfaction. The carriage entered a long
avenue, the gate of which lay ready opened for
it; and about an hour and a quarter after leaving
Abermaw, it drew up before the Joneses’ house
near Harlech.</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, Miss Marrable threw open
the door and sprang out, to find herself in the
presence of half-a-dozen people who were congregated
upon the steps.</p>

<p>‘Quick!’ she cried; ‘don’t ask questions! He
is ill; he is dying. Take him out!’</p>

<p>The Joneses, who had not been prepared for
the apparition of a middle-aged spinster, and who
were expecting Mr Jellicoe and Miss Allerton,
were somewhat astonished.</p>

<p>‘Who is inside?’ asked Mr Tom Jones, the son
and heir of the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">{200}</span></p>

<p>‘Oh! Mr Jellicoe! Be quick! For mercy’s
sake, be quick!’</p>

<p>‘You don’t mean it!’ cried Tom, rushing to
the carriage to succour his friend. But an instant
later he burst into a violent fit of laughter. ‘Why,
it’s not Jellicoe at all!’ he said. ‘It’s Griffiths,
the billiard-marker from the <i>Cors-y-Gedol</i>; and he
is hopelessly drunk. Nice companion, indeed!’</p>

<p>Miss Marrable is, as I have already said, a
woman without weaknesses. On hearing this
announcement, however, she fainted away. When,
thanks to the kind attentions of the female
members of the Joneses’ family, she revived, she
indignantly charged those estimable people with
having deliberately plotted her discomfiture; and
she insisted upon at once returning to Abermaw;
but the carriage (and Griffiths) had gone; so Mr
Jones, senior, who grasped the situation, volunteered
to drive Miss Marrable back to the <i>Cors-y-Gedol
Hotel</i>; and by twelve o’clock, or shortly
afterwards, she was again in her own room. It
was then that she learned of the desertion of Lucy
and Amy. I need not describe how she received
the news, and how she declared that her abandoned
nieces should never again behold her face;
nor that, although she is a woman without weaknesses,
she passed the greater part of the remainder
of the night in violent hysterics. She telegraphed
next day to Mr Larkspur and Mr Allerton; and
repairing to the <i>Red Cow</i>, furiously denounced Sir
Thomas Jellicoe as the basest and most heartless
of men!</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards, however, the edge of
her anger had worn off. Lucy and Amy were
married. It was foolish, but, perhaps, it was
not wholly inexcusable; and thus reasoning, Miss
Marrable, in the goodness of her heart, determined
to gradually receive them back into her
favour. But she has never wholly forgiven Lucy
for suggesting the substitution of the billiard-marker
for Vivian Jellicoe.</p>

<p>‘My dear,’ she says, when she retells the story
of her drive to Harlech, ‘the wretched man was
perfectly saturated with whisky, and I really
don’t know what he might not have done if I
hadn’t kept my eye steadily on him. But beneath
my gaze he cowered, my dear, positively cowered!
I never saw a savage brute so completely tamed.’</p>

<p>And to this day Miss Marrable believes that
but for her Eye, the billiard-marker might—horrid
thought!—have run away with her too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the case of such a curiosity in official journalism

which was commenced shortly after the formation
of the metropolitan police force in 1828, is not
allowed to circulate beyond constabulary circles;
but its efficiency of management unquestionably
concerns the general community. Previous to
the year 1828, the metropolis, like other centres
of population, was under the care of the old
parochial Watch, who, as corrupt as they were
feeble, became an absolute street nuisance. Far
from being a terror to evil-doers, their notorious
negligence and inefficiency enabled the midnight
burglar or daring footpad to pursue his criminal
avocation with comparative impunity. Peel’s Act
introduced a greatly improved <i>régime</i>; and the new
police, nicknamed after their originator, were for
a long time popularly known as ‘Peelers.’ The
newly established force required new methods of
working, and one of these was the starting of an
official newspaper which, though it is perhaps the
only one the public never see, has nevertheless
often done them good service, and is now to be
made of still more value.</p>

<p>It is probably known to few that there exists in
connection with the Detective department at Scotland
Yard a regular printing establishment, from
which sheets are issued four times a day containing
information as to persons ‘wanted,’ current offences,
property stolen, lost, or found. A daily list of
property stolen is also printed, and distributed
to all licensed pawnbrokers. Particulars received
from country constabulary forces are inserted
in these publications, which are carefully read at
parades and studied by the detectives. This,
however, only applies to the metropolis; and a
strong desire has long prevailed at headquarters
to make that larger medium of publicity, the
<i>Police Gazette</i>, more useful as a means of intercommunication
between the whole of the two
hundred and ninety police forces of the kingdom.
Until the beginning of the present year, that
wretched print had shown scarcely any progress
or improvement since it was commenced. Its
direction has hitherto been nominally in the
hands of the chief clerk at Bow Street police
court. In the past, much of its space has been
wasted by the frequent repetition of details as
to trifling cases; and no systematic arrangements
were made for the widespread circulation
of the paper among those for whom it is specially
intended. The editorship has now been committed
to Mr Howard Vincent, director of criminal
investigations, who will be assisted by Chief-inspector
Cutbush of the executive department
at Scotland Yard. It is to the initiation of Mr
Vincent that the improvements now made are
chiefly due; and it may be remembered that in
his presidential address to the Repression of
Crime Section of the recent Social Congress at
Huddersfield, that gentleman explained his intentions.
The proposals he made were so favourably
received, that subscriptions amounting to nearly
one thousand pounds were placed at his disposal.
These, however, have not been needed, as it
happens that the improvements have been
accompanied by an actual reduction of expense;
and the Home Secretary has determined that
the costs, limited within a certain moderate
sum, shall still be borne entirely by the public
funds.</p>

<p>In addition to being much better printed, the
new <i>Gazette</i> already shows decided improvement
both in the selection and arrangement of its
contents. For convenient reference, particulars
are not only grouped according to the usual
categories of crime, but are now classified under
special headings for the various districts to
which cases belong. Illustrations have also been
introduced as a new feature. These take the
form of woodcuts from photographs of persons
‘wanted’ on various charges, or of valuable articles
stolen. The first number of the <i>Gazette</i> contains
the likeness of several criminals of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">{201}</span>
the authorities are in pursuit. In one instance,
so as to aid identification, the subject is shown
not only with beard and moustache, but also as
he would appear when clean shaved. Some of
these faces, it is true, seem decent and commonplace
enough, such as one sees almost every
hour of the day in the public streets; but others,
‘an index of all villainy,’ are unmistakably those
of dangerous characters whom none of us would
like to meet alone in a quiet road on a dark
night. But it is in the police album<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that we
can best study the variety of expression by which
the human countenance can betray every shade
of criminal depravity.</p>

<p>Meantime our business is only with the <i>Gazette</i>,
which, among other changes, has altered its days
of publication. Hitherto it has been issued three
times every week; but now that the space is
more carefully utilised, twice a week is found
sufficient. The War Office and Admiralty have
always had the privilege of inserting in its pages
a list and description of deserters from the army
and navy. In future, the Tuesday’s issue will
be entirely devoted to these matters; and when
it is known that last year the total number of
deserters was only one short of six thousand, it
may be inferred that the weekly list does not
leave much space to spare in a small four-page
paper. The Friday’s issue extends to eight pages,
and is reserved exclusively for police information,
with the exception of two pages now set apart
by contract for advertising purposes. As far as
increased circulation is concerned, arrangements
have been made to send supplies of the <i>Gazette</i> not
only to every police force in the United Kingdom,
but also, through the government offices, to the
guardians of the peace in the British colonies and
India. From the public generally, the <i>Gazette</i> is
withheld.</p>

<p>The early issues of the <i>Gazette</i>, especially
between 1829 and 1831, bear significant testimony
to the labour disturbances and political excitement
which immediately preceded the passing of the
great Reform Bill. Every number was then
largely occupied with royal proclamations in the
cause of order, and offers in Lord Melbourne’s
name of government rewards for the arrest of
incendiaries and disturbers of the public peace.
Again we are on the eve of parliamentary reform,
but without any symptoms of rioting; and the
improved columns of the <i>Hue and Cry</i> are now
left more free for ordinary police information as
to the appearance and lawless doings of the
‘incorrigible’ class.</p>

SCIENCE AND ARTS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the Report issued by the Committee appointed
to consider the best way of rebuilding
the houses at Casamicciola destroyed in the
recent earthquake, we learn that that terrible
catastrophe occasioned the deaths of no fewer
than two thousand three hundred and thirteen
persons, and injury to seven hundred and sixty-two
more. Although these unfortunates did not
all actually belong to the island, there were
among them only fifty-four who could be called
foreigners. It will probably be found advisable
to rebuild the ruined habitations on the pattern
adopted in certain places of Central America,
where earthquakes are common. The houses
there are built of such light materials, that when
a shock comes, they rattle down like a veritable
house of cards, and can almost be rattled together
again as easily when the danger has for the time
passed. In London and some other of our cities
and towns, the houses are so shamefully run up
that a very mild shock of earthquake would
suffice to shake them to pieces.</p>

<p>We are apt to look upon these jerry-built houses
as the result of competition and the continual cry
for cheap houses. On the other hand, we regard
our cathedrals as solid monuments to the more
honest work of former times. But this notion
must be dispelled. The Peterborough Cathedral
architect has been examining the foundations and
piers of the tower of that fabric, which it will
be remembered he some time ago reported to
be in a dangerous condition, and they turn out
to be as perfect an example of jerry-building
as could be found in our own enlightened times.
The piers were found to consist of a thin facing
of stone, the interior being filled in with small
rubble-stone and sandy earth. He tells us that
‘it is impossible to conceive a worse piece of construction,
and it is equally impossible to understand
how it is that these piers have stood so
long.’ The piers have simply been enabled to
hold together by the strength of their exterior
clothing. It is some small satisfaction to the
modern householder that dishonest building has
not been invented for his especial torment, but was
practised as long ago as the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>Another far more valuable relic of the past
is, as we recently indicated, exciting attention
on account of its decaying condition. Westminster
Abbey, which may justly be regarded
as the most important ecclesiastical building in
the kingdom, is wasting away piecemeal under
the effects of London smoke and atmospheric
agencies generally. The sum required for its
restoration is estimated at eighty thousand pounds,
and this is probably short of the real amount
which will be required to do the work effectually.
For such a national purpose, the purse of the
nation ought undoubtedly to be responsible.</p>

<p>The complete Report of Professor Hull’s labours,
as chief of the little band of scientific explorers
who have just returned from a geological survey
of Palestine, will be looked forward to with
unusual interest, for he brings back with him
materials for constructing a far more complete
map than has ever before been possible. The
ancient sea-margins of the Gulfs of Suez and
Akabah have been traced at a height of two
hundred feet above their present surfaces—indicating
that the Mediterranean and Red Seas
have been at one time in natural connection
with one another. Professor Hull believes that
this was the case at the time of the Exodus.
The terraces of the Jordan have also been examined,
the most important of these ancient
margins being six hundred feet above the present
level of the Dead Sea. Besides his scientific
Report, the learned Professor is preparing a
popular account of his pilgrimage, which will
duly appear in the Transactions of the Geological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">{202}</span>
Society. His journeyings will cover much of
the same ground traversed nearly fifty years ago
by David Roberts, whose drawings of the places
visited aroused so much interest at the time, and
which have never since been surpassed.</p>

<p>Not very many years ago, a map of Africa
presented in its centre a blank space, which was
explained to inquiring children as indicating a
country so hot that nobody had been there or
could live there. This benighted region has now
an atlas all to itself. Under the auspices of the
Geographical Society, Mr Ravenstein has just
completed their map of Eastern Equatorial Africa;
it is of large size, and contains altogether twenty-five
sheets. He will now commence a similar
work for Western Africa, and has proceeded to
Portugal in order to take advantage of the
materials in the possession of that government
bearing upon the subject. This work is also
undertaken for and at the expense of the Geographical
Society.</p>

<p>The official Report of the late census in British
Burmah is not without interest to dwellers in
Britain. Only two languages had to be used in
the process of enumeration—namely, Burmese
and English. The people at first thought that
the strange proceedings heralded the advent of
a new tax, and one tribe fled across the frontier
so as to be out of the way. Another idea that
occurred to the people was that the English made
use of human heads for inquiring into the future.
But these difficulties having been smoothed over,
the census was taken satisfactorily. British
Burmah is, roughly speaking, of the same area
as Great Britain and Ireland, with a population
less than that of London. This population, under
British rule, has doubled in twenty years, and
there is every sign of its continued increase.
The males are far in excess of the females, and
what seems a very important key to the wonderful
prosperity of the country is the fact that
there are ten acres of cultivated land for every
eight persons living in it.</p>

<p>It is reported that Baron Nordenskïold, whose
recent explorations in and around Greenland
aroused so much interest in scientific circles, is
contemplating a voyage next year to the south
polar regions. The cost of the projected expedition
is nearly two hundred thousand pounds, but
this seemingly large sum will include the expense
of building a ship of special construction, to meet
the requirements of the explorers.</p>

<p>International courtesies are so very few and
far between, that when one occurs it is worthy
of the most honourable mention. Many years
ago, a band of English Arctic explorers abandoned
their ship, the <i>Resolute</i>, for it was hopelessly
frozen into the ice-pack. The ship, however, at
last floated free, and was taken by an American
whaler to New York. The gallant Americans
thereupon put the vessel into splendid order, and
presented her to Queen Victoria. It was but the
other day that the old ship was broken up, when
a desk was made from her timbers and presented to
the American President. The British government
have now presented the <i>Alert</i>, which has also
seen Arctic service, to the United States government
for the use of the Greeley relief expedition.
The ship has long ago been strengthened with
teak for protection against the ice, and is thus
well fitted for the purpose in view.</p>

<p>The recent experiments at Folkestone once
more proved the value of throwing oil on
troubled waters, the efficacy of which operation
in stormy weather we described last month. In
addition to the oil-shell there mentioned, another
invention falls to be noticed, by which the same
gun from which the oil-shell is discharged may be
also employed for projecting a heavy solid cylindrical
shot, to which is attached a flexible tubing.
Upon firing the gun, the shot is carried a long
distance out to sea, pulling the tube after it.
The shot sinks to the bottom, and the tube thus
anchored can be used with a pump for forcing
the oil to any spot in the neighbourhood. This
contrivance, like that of the oil-shell, is the
invention of Mr Gordon.</p>

<p>The preparations for the International Health
Exhibition to be opened in London in May next,
proceed very rapidly. The eight water-companies
which supply London, and which just now are being
so roundly abused on the score of overcharges,
will exhibit the various apparatus employed by
them for the supply, filtration, &amp;c., of water.
They will also combine in erecting an immense
fountain in the grounds, the jets of which will
be brilliantly illuminated at night by electricity.</p>

<p>An American paper gives an interesting account
of the manufacture of ‘Yankee sardines,’ which
may be explained to the uninitiated to mean
small herrings preserved in oil and flavoured
with spices, to imitate the sardines of French
preparation. To begin with, the fish are laid
in heaps on long tables, where they are rapidly
cleaned and decapitated by children. The
herrings are then pickled for one hour, to remove
a certain tell-tale flavour which they possess,
after which they are dried. The next operation
is to thoroughly cook them in boiling oil; and
finally, they are packed in the familiar square
tins, and duly furnished with a French label, such
as, ‘Sardines à la Francaise,’ or, ‘A l’huile d’olive.’
The free, or rather the true translation of this latter
inscription would be, ‘cotton-seed oil,’ and, sad
to say, not always of the first quality.</p>

<p>A paper dealing with an outbreak in a German
town of that terrible disease known as trichinosis
was recently read before the French Academy of
Medicine. It is worthy of attention as going far
to prove that this disease, usually contracted by the
consumption of unwholesome pork, is avoidable,
if the ordinary precaution of thoroughly cooking
the food be resorted to. In the case in question,
more than three hundred persons were attacked
with the disease, and of these nearly one-sixth
died. It was proved beyond question that all
the victims ate the meat absolutely raw, it being
the custom to chop it fine and to spread it like
butter on slices of bread. One single family,
which consumed some of the same meat in the
form of cooked sausages, exhibited no trace of
the disease. It may be mentioned that a certain
dose of alcohol exercised a most favourable
effect in diminishing the virulence of the
complaint.</p>

<p>A new system of railway signals which is
worked by electricity, instead of by mechanical
leverage, has lately been experimented upon with
great success, but like most other things of an
electrical kind, its ready adoption must depend
upon its expense as compared with that of the
older-fashioned plant. Hitherto, the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">{203}</span>
electric magnet has been found unequal to this
class of work, principally because its power of
attraction is only great when very near the object
to be attracted, and also because its impact on its
armature is so violent as to lead to risk of deranging
the apparatus employed. By use of what is
known as the long-pull electro-magnet, recently
invented by Mr Stanley Currie, these difficulties
have been obviated, and signals of every kind
can be worked most perfectly through the medium
of conducting wires. The system has been at
work for the past two months at Gloucester, and
is being adopted experimentally in other directions.</p>

<p>The volcano at Krakatoa will long be remembered,
if only on account of the wide area over
which its products have been distributed. To say
nothing of the dust particles which are supposed
to have found their origin there, and which are
credited with having been the active cause of our
late gorgeous sunsets, undoubted volcanic particles
have lately been found at Philadelphia. By melting
and evaporating the snow upon which these
tiny fragments were found, a residue of solid
particles was apparent, which the microscope at
once pronounced to be of a volcanic nature. It
seems difficult to believe that solid matter could
thus be carried in the air for four months, during
which it must, if it came from Krakatoa, have
covered the enormous distance of ten thousand
miles. Another supposition is that the volcanic
particles found at Philadelphia may have been
wafted thither from Alaska, in the north-west
corner of North America, where a great eruption
has occurred. According to our authority, a submarine
volcano shot up there last summer, and
has already formed an island in the Behring
Sea, from eight hundred to twelve hundred feet
high. It is therefore possible that volcanic dust
may have found its way, from this source, to
the southern states of America, and even to Great
Britain. The enormous distances traversed by
these glassy particles may be thus accounted for:
when steam is forced through a mass of glassy
lava, the molten material is shot up with it in
the form of thin filaments, just like spun glass.
These, like so many pieces of spider web, would be
borne aloft by the air for a very long period.</p>

<p>It seems only yesterday that iron furnace slag
was looked upon as a waste product, for which
no possible use could be found. It is now made
into bricks, into cement, into wool-packing for
steam-boilers, and more recently it has been
found a most effective material for making all
kinds of vases and other things of an ornamental
nature. For this purpose, the slag is freed of
its coarser particles, mixed with a certain quantity
of glass and colouring matter, and when in a
molten condition, is stirred about so as to present
a veined appearance. It is then moulded
into various forms, and is ready for sale.</p>

<p>We lately had an opportunity of visiting the
Fine Art Loan Exhibition at Cardiff, which
has been opened for three months, for the
purpose of collecting funds in aid of the projected
Cambrian Academy. The Exhibition
includes works by some of our most eminent
artists, both living and deceased, as well as a
collection of such articles as can be grouped
under the head of Art. But a novel feature
of the Exhibition is its complete array of telephonic
and telegraphic apparatus. By the
co-operation of the telegraphic authorities, communication
has been opened up by telephone
between the Exhibition and Swansea, a distance
of fifty-two miles. Not only is speech quite
easy over this distance, but the voices of those
acquainted with one another are readily recognised.
At the time of our visit, the apparatus
was connected with the theatre at Swansea, and
we had the curious experience of listening to
chorus, band, and solo voices, which were rendering
a popular opera more than half a hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>Mr J. C. Robinson, in the course of an
interesting article contributed to the <i>Times</i> on
the conservation of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s pictures,
concludes with a recommendation which
all owners of valuable oil-paintings should take
note of. He strongly advocates the use of glass
as a covering for such pictures, and is glad to
see that the practice of thus framing them is
on the increase. ‘This plan,’ he says, ‘almost
entirely obviates the necessity for the periodical
rubbing up and cleaning the surface of pictures
with the silk handkerchief or cotton-wool,
inasmuch as the protecting glass, and not the
painted surface of the picture, receives the
rapidly accumulating deposit of dust and dirt.’
But even this he considers to be only a half-measure.
The back of the picture should be
stretched over with a damp-resisting sheet of
india-rubber or American cloth, for it requires
protection only second to the painted face of
the canvas.</p>

<p>In presenting the gold medal of the Royal
Astronomical Society to Mr A. Common for his
wonderful photographs of celestial objects, the
President of that honourable body gave a most
interesting history of the medallist’s gradual
progress in the difficult work in which he so
much excels. Mr Common commenced work
with a modest reflecting telescope of five and a
half inches; but he was not satisfied until he had
obtained one measuring no less than three feet
across its mirror. He has also turned his earnest
attention to the clockwork for driving the instrument,
so that as the busy world turns on its
axis, the objects focused remain stationary. This
is highly necessary, when it is remembered that
sometimes a star photograph occupies as much
as an hour and a half in the taking, even with
the most sensitive plates. This long duration of
the action of the feeble light from stars so remote
that they cannot be seen by the naked eye, has
the effect of impressing the chemical surface so
that the invisible is pictured! It is evident that
a new field of research is thus opened out; and
the President did well in pointing out what
great services can be rendered to knowledge by
the amateur worker who, like Mr Common, has
the means and the ability to employ his time
so well.</p>

<p>In these days of oleomargarine, bosch butter,
and other mixtures which are supposed to furnish
excellent substitutes for the genuine article, it
becomes highly necessary to have some means of
distinguishing the true from the false. A contribution
to microscopical science towards this end is
a test discovered by Dr Belfield of Chicago, which
will at once identify a fat if it consist either of
lard or tallow. Pure lard crystals exhibit thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">{204}</span>
rhomboidal plates, while those of tallow are quite
different, and are of a curved form somewhat
resembling the italic letter <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>A paper on the Ventilation of Theatres was
lately read by Mr Seddon at the Parkes Museum
of Hygiene, London. In some crowded theatres,
the air has been said by a competent authority
to be more foul than that of the street sewers.
The intensely heated air would seem to act as
a kind of pump, and to extract the vitiated
atmosphere from the drains below the building.
The successful introduction of the electric incandescent
system of lighting to more than one
metropolitan theatre has done much to mitigate
the evil complained of; but it is quite certain
that the ventilation of public buildings generally
does not receive the attention which it so imperatively
demands.</p>

<p>Another important consideration that is too
often neglected is the acoustic properties of public
buildings. Even in the last great work which
has, after years of labour, been finished in
London—we refer to the new law-courts—complaints
are constant from those who have to
work in them, of the great difficulty both in
making their voices heard and in appreciating
what is said by others. Public speakers whose
duties carry them to various towns and cities
throughout the kingdom, know very well that it is
the exception, and not the rule, to find a room
which is comfortable to speak in. Either the
voice falls dead and flat, as if absorbed by
a screen of wool; or it reverberates from every
wall with such confusing echoes, that the
syllables must be uttered with painful deliberation.
A Committee appointed by one of
our learned Societies to inquire into the reason
why some rooms should be acoustically perfect,
while others are quite the reverse, would do a
vast amount of good. Until such an inquiry
is set on foot, architects will continue to design
buildings in which this necessary property is
quite neglected.</p>

<h3>INTERESTING NOTES ON TROUT-LIFE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a recent meeting of the Scotch Fisheries
Improvement Association, held at Edinburgh,
Mr Harvie-Brown communicated some notes on
trout-life, which the Association considered of so
much scientific interest, that it was resolved to
engross them in the minutes. The notes are as
follow:</p>

<p>‘The subject of coloration of flesh of trout is
a much more intricate one than at first appears.
I know of trout holding largely developed spawn
in June and July in a loch in Sutherland, whose
flesh is not pink only, but bright red like a
salmon’s, and yet are not fit to be eaten. I know,
also, in a limestone burn the very finest trout,
which on the table are perfectly white in the flesh,
whatever size they grow to; but in another
limestone burn from the same sources, or nearly
so, the trout are quite different in appearance
externally, but equally white in flesh and equally
delicious for eating.</p>

<p>‘I put a quarter-pound trout, along with others,
into a previously barren loch. In two years
some of these trout attained to four and a quarter
pound-weight, developed huge fins and square
or rounded tails, lost all spots, took on a coat
of dark slime, grew huge teeth, and became <i>feroces</i>
in that short time. The common burn trout,
taken from a very high rocky burn up in the hills,
in two years became indistinguishable from <i>Salmo
ferox</i>. The first year they grew to about a pound,
or a pound and a half, took on a bright silvery
sheen of scales, were deep and high shouldered,
lusty and powerful, more resembling Loch Leven
trout than any others. This was when their
feeding and condition were at their best; but as
food decreased, and the trout rapidly increased in
number, spawning in innumerable quantities, and
with no enemies, the larger fish began to prey on the
smaller, grew big teeth, swam deep, and lost colour,
grew large fins and a big head, and became <i>Salmo
ferox</i> so called. In two years more the food-supply
became exhausted; and now the chain of lochs
holds nothing but huge, lanky, kelty-looking fish
and swarms of diminutive “black nebs,” neither
of the sorts deserving of the angler’s notice. The
first year they were splendid fish—rich and fat.
Now they are dry and tasteless.’</p>


<h3>LABOUR AND WAGES IN AUSTRALIA.</h3>

<p>It would appear from the latest statistics that
during the past few years wages have risen in
some trades, and in a few only, have fallen. In
the skilled branches of labour especially the
tendency has been upwards, and the same thing
is also noticeable in agricultural labour. For
example, the rates for married couples on stations
have risen from fifty-five to sixty-five
pounds in 1876 to sixty or eighty pounds in
1883. The wages of farm-labourers have risen
to fifty pounds or thereabouts, while only in the
case of country blacksmiths have wages declined,
the rates for such being now seventy-five to eighty
pounds per annum. The colony is stated to be
capable of readily absorbing any amount of
skilled agricultural labour, especially that of the
handy kind, without affecting the current rates
of wages. Agricultural labour is in more demand
than artisan labour, and good industrious hands
would do excellently, as compared with the same
class in England, both in regard to food and pay.
With regard to other occupations, the following
rates are paid on the New South Wales railways:
clerks, two hundred to one hundred and fifty
pounds per annum; foremen, five pounds ten
shillings to three pounds seven shillings per week;
draftsmen, four pounds fifteen shillings per week;
timekeepers, three to two pounds per week;
fitters, 12s. 4d. to 8s. per day; blacksmiths, 12s. 8d.
to 10s. 4d. per day; turners, 12s. 2d. to 10s. 2d.
per day; pattern makers, 11s. 10d. per day; brass-moulders,
11s. 4d. per day; plumbers, 11s. to 10s.
per day; tinsmiths, 11s. to 10s. per day; brass-finishers,
9s. 6d. to 9s. per day; carpenters, 11s. 6d.
to 8s. per day; painters, 11s. to 9s. 8d. per day;
strikers, 7s. 4d. to 7s. per day; and cleaners, 7s.
per day. The working day in the case of many
trades does not exceed eight hours.</p>


<h3>THE RUSSIAN CROWN ESTATES.</h3>

<p>While so much is written of the internal economy
of Russia, many will be surprised to hear of the
extraordinary extent of the lands which form the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">{205}</span>
estates of the Crown. The extent of the possessions
of the Russian emperor may be gathered
from the fact that the Altai estates alone cover
an area of over one hundred and seventy thousand
square miles, being about three times the size of
England and Wales. The Nertchinsk estates, in
Eastern Siberia, are estimated at about seventy-six
thousand six hundred square miles, or more
than twice the size of Scotland and Wales put
together. In the Altai estates are situated the
gold and silver mines of Barnaul, Paulov, Smijov,
and Loktjepp, the copper foundry at Sasoum,
and the great iron-works of Gavrilov, in the
Salagirov district. The receipts from these
enormous estates are in a ridiculously pitiful
ratio to their extent. In the year 1882 they
amounted to nine hundred and fifty thousand
roubles, or a little more than ninety-five thousand
pounds; while for 1883 the revenue was estimated
at less than half this sum, or about four hundred
thousand roubles. The rents, &amp;c., gave a surplus
over expense of administration of about a million
and a half of roubles, or about one hundred and
fifty thousand pounds. On the other hand, the
working of the mines showed a deficit of over
a million; hence the result just indicated. A
partial explanation of this very unsatisfactory
state of things is to be found in the situation
of the mines, which are generally in places quite
destitute of wood, while the smelting-works were
naturally located in districts where wood abounds,
sometimes as much as three hundred and four
hundred miles distant from the mines. The cost
of transport of raw materials became considerable
in this way. By degrees, all the wood available
in the neighbourhood of the smelting-works
became used up, and it was necessary to fetch
wood from distances of even over one hundred
kilometres. Formerly, the mines were really
penal settlements, worked by convicts, who were
partly helped by immigrants, whose sons were
exempted from military service on the condition
of working in the mines. But since the abolition
of serfdom this system has been quite altered,
and there is now a great deal of free labour on
the ordinary conditions.</p>


<h3>HYDROPHOBIA—IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>M. Pasteur, who has already made so many
valuable discoveries in connection with diseases
that are propagated by germs, has, in his own
name and that of his assistants, MM. Chamberlan
and Roux, communicated to the French Academies
of Sciences and Medicine the results of his experimental
inoculations with the virus of rabies.
He finds that the virus may remain in the nervous
tissues without manifestation for three weeks,
even during the summer months. Virulence is
manifested not merely in the nervous tissues,
but in the parotid and sub-lingual glands. The
granulations observed in the fourth ventricle,
when in a state of virulence, are finer than the
granulations in the fourth ventricle when in a
healthy state, and they can be coloured by means
of aniline derivatives. The virus of rabies injected
into the veins or beneath the skin produces
paralytic rabies, while inoculations into the spinal
cord or the brain produce the paroxysmal form.
Inoculations with quantities of the virus too small
to be effective, have no preservative influence
against subsequent inoculations. Whether the
virus is propagated by means of the nervous
tissues or by absorption through the surfaces of
the wound, has not been ascertained. Finally,
the experiments have shown that the protective
‘attenuation’ of the virus is possible. The energy
or the nature of the virus varies in each species
of animals. By passing the virus through different
animals, ‘cultures,’ or varying qualities of
virus, are obtained, whose precise effects can be
predicted. Thus a ‘culture’ has been obtained
which certainly kills a rabbit in five or six
days, and another which certainly kills a
guinea-pig in the same time. Other things being
equal, the virulence varies inversely with the
duration of the incubation. M. Pasteur and his
assistants have good reason to believe that by
means of a special culture they have succeeded
in making twenty dogs absolutely proof against
rabid inoculations. M. Pasteur, with his usual
caution, asks for a little longer time before finally
pronouncing on the condition of the dogs in
question. To devise a means of making the dog
proof against rabies is, of course, to devise a
means of almost certainly preserving man
(including children) from this frightful disorder;
for hydrophobia is almost invariably communicated
to man and other animals by the bites of
rabid dogs.</p>


<h3>THE ELECTRIC LIGHT IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES.</h3>

<p>An interesting experiment was commenced just
after Christmas last by the District Railway
Company, on the short branch line which connects
Kensington and Fulham, passing through
Earl’s Court and Walham Green. On the 2d of
January last, the carriages running on this short
line were lighted for the first time, each with
a small Swan burner, inclosed in a little glass
globe; and although only a very small coil of fine
wire, thin as a hair, shaped something like a letter
U, was employed, the light was so brilliant and
steady that the smallest print could be read by
it easily. The experiment lasted about a fortnight
or three weeks, and was worked from a luggage
van attached to the rear of the train, and fitted
up for the purpose. This experiment is interesting,
and the result has been most successful, not
a slip, nor a hitch of any kind, having occurred;
while the reports as to cost are, it is understood,
perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Let us hope that this beautiful system of lighting
may speedily be introduced on the different
railways throughout the country; and especially
on the District line of the Metropolitan Railway,
where the bad blinking gas is so terribly trying
to those who have to make two journeys a day
by it, and who desire to employ the time of transit
with their book or their paper, which becomes
a work of difficulty under the present gas arrangements,
but which may possibly be explained by
one word, ‘economy;’ for it is a well-established
fact, patent to all, that gas is light and brilliant
enough for most purposes, provided a proper and
sufficient <i>quantity</i> is used.</p>


<h3>DISSECTION AFTER DEATH.</h3>

<p>Amongst the strange institutions which have
been started within the last few years is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">{206}</span>
of ‘The Society for Mutual Autopsy,’ which commenced
its existence in Paris in the year 1876.
No balloting or any elaborate system is necessary
to become a member. A proper introduction
with a fee of five francs suffices, and an engagement
to will your body to the Society for the
purpose of dissection after death. In order to
prevent the friends and relatives of the dead
from frustrating the intentions of the testator,
by disposing of the corpse in the usual manner,
a proper legal form has been drawn up and
inscribed in the Rules. This Society, which consists
of about two hundred members, a dozen of
whom are ladies, contains amongst its members
many men eminent in the medical world in Paris,
as well as distinguished in science and art. The
theory of the founders is, that in consequence of
the difficulty of obtaining for post-mortem examinations
any other subjects but those of the
lowest classes, whose faculties are naturally warped
or otherwise undeveloped, much benefit must
accrue to science by an opportunity being given
for the dissection of persons of cultivated understanding,
and particularly by making observations
on the brain. Between twenty and thirty
of the members of this Society generally dine
together once a month at a restaurant near the
Halles, where they pass a congenial evening,
although there is a touch of ghastliness in the
gathering. When one of their community is
missing at the banquet, instead of lamenting over
his departure, every one listens with rapt interest
to the surgeon’s explanation of the post-mortem
examination he has made.</p>


<h3>PREVENTION OF BLINDNESS IN INFANCY.</h3>

<p>The Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association
recently issued a paper, based upon the
directions of the Society for the Prevention of
Blindness. From it we learn that one of the
most frequent causes of blindness is the inflammation
of the eyes of new-born babies. Yet this
is a disease which can be entirely prevented by
cleanliness, and always cured if taken in time.
The essential precautions against the disease are:
(1) Immediately after the birth of the baby, and
before anything else is done, wipe the eyelids
and all parts surrounding the eyes with a soft
dry linen rag; soon afterwards wash these parts
with tepid water before any other part is touched.
(2) Avoid exposing the baby to cold air; do not
take it into the open air in cold weather; dress
the infant warmly, and cover its head, because
cold is also one of the causes of this eye-disease.
When the disease appears, it is easily and at once
recognised by the redness, swelling, and heat of
the eyelids, and by the discharge of yellowish
white matter from the eye. Immediately on the
appearance of these signs, seek the advice of a
medical man; but in the meantime, proceed at
once to keep the eyes as clean as possible by very
frequently cleansing away the discharge. It is
the discharge which does the mischief. The
cleansing of the eye is best done in this way:
(1) Separate the eyelids with the finger and thumb,
and wash out the matter by allowing a gentle
stream of lukewarm water to run between them
from a piece of rag or cotton-wool held two or
three inches above the eyes. (2) Then move the
eyelids up and down and from side to side in a
gentle rubbing way, to bring out the matter from
below them; then wipe it or wash it off in the
same manner. This cleansing will take three or
four minutes, and it is to be repeated regularly
every half-hour at first, and later, if there is less
discharge, every hour. (3) The saving of the sight
depends entirely on the greatest care and attention
to cleanliness. Small pieces of clean rag are
better than a sponge, as each rag is to be used
once only, and then burnt immediately; sponges
should never be used, except they are burnt after
each washing. (4) A little washed lard should
be smeared along the edges of the eyelids
occasionally, to prevent them from sticking. Of
all the mistaken practices which ignorance is apt
to resort to, none is more ruinous than the use
of poultices. Let them be dreaded and shunned
as the destroyers of a new-born baby’s sight.
Tea-leaves and sugar-of-lead lotion are equally
conducive to terrible mischief, stopping the way,
as they do, to the only right and proper course
to be taken.</p>


<h3>CARD-TELEGRAMS.</h3>

<p>Great as have been recent improvements in
our postal service, we have yet to learn something
from the Parisians, whose system of Card-telegrams
is worthy of notice. The cards are of two
kinds—namely, yellow similar to our own, and
blue, which, when secrecy is desired, may be
closed. By dropping the card into the Card
Telegram Box at the nearest telegraph office, it
is shot through one of the pneumatic tubes which
are now being extended all over Paris, and is
delivered at its destination within half an hour.
Fifty to seventy words can be written on the
card, the cost of which is threepence. It is
further intended to permit of cards being dropped
into the boxes up to fifteen minutes of the
departure of the mail-trains, a boon which merchants
in Great Britain may well envy.</p>


<h3>HOW AND WHERE THE HERRING SPAWNS.</h3>

<p>According to a contemporary, we learn that
Professor Cossar Ewart, Edinburgh University,
convener of the Scientific Investigation Committee
of the Board of Fisheries, was at the beginning
of March at the well-known fishing-ground off
the coast of Ayrshire known as the banks of
Ballantrae, when some interesting investigations
were made into the nature of the sea-bottom
and spawn deposited on that famous herring-bed.
The banks were dredged from a depth
of eight to twenty-two fathoms. At a depth
of eight to eleven fathoms the bottom was
composed of clean gravel, with very little seaweed;
beyond the eleven fathoms, clay, mud, and
shell. On the stones lifted by the dredge,
portions of herring spawn were found firmly
attached to the surface of the stones in different
stages of development, the more advanced manifesting,
in lively action, the embryo herring.
Spawn was also taken from the living herring
and placed on glasses in hatching-boxes, and
these also showed the eggs in progress of development.
From a small stone of a few inches of
surface as many eggs were found as, if allowed to
arrive at maturity, would have yielded crans of
herrings. The information obtained by Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">{207}</span>
Cossar Ewart, during his recent dredgings, will
be of the greatest importance in throwing light
upon a hitherto but imperfectly understood question
in natural history.</p>

<p>The banks in the evening presented a scene
of lively interest, for as the sun began to set, a
school of at least forty whales and porpoises
began to play, and, circling around the margin
of the fishing-banks, rose and fell in graceful
plunges, their black fins and backs rising in curves
for a moment, and then disappearing, while the
porpoises made wild leaps many feet clear out
of the water. Their presence was accounted for
next morning, when a good many of the seine
trawlers entered Loch Ryan and Girvan with
from one to three hundred baskets of herrings
each.</p>

<p>Professor Cossar Ewart has since had some
more successful dredgings. He has also made
some important discoveries regarding natural and
artificial spawning, and deposited live herring
and a quantity of spawn in the aquarium at
Rothesay.</p>


<h3>A FLOURISHING FRUIT-FARM.</h3>

<p>At Toddington, in Gloucestershire, there has
been going on for a few years the cultivation of
fruit on a very large scale; a fruit-farm of five
hundred acres having been planted by Lord
Sudeley, and which, we are glad to know, has
proved so successful, that its area is about to
be enlarged to the extent of other two hundred
acres. An enormous number of fruit-trees
of many kinds has been planted, along
with thousands of currant-bushes, whilst upwards
of a hundred acres of the land are
devoted to the growth of strawberries. A noteworthy
feature of the scheme consists of a market
being found for the smaller fruits on the ground
on which they have been grown. In other words,
Lord Sudeley has, with great foresight, erected
a suite of boiling-houses and packing-rooms,
which have been let to an enterprising person,
who manufactures genuine jams and jellies from
the fruit grown at Toddington. In fruit-preserving,
the English and Scotch boilers—and the
latter class have largely increased during the last
few years—have a great advantage over their
brethren of the continent and the United States,
because of the greater cheapness of the sugar,
which is required in large quantities. It is to
be hoped that the example set by Lord Sudeley
will be speedily followed by some of his territorial
brethren. As a nation, we could manage to consume
much more fruit than we do at present,
if we could obtain it at a moderate price. In
the orchards at Toddington have been planted
as many as thirty-two thousand plum-trees, nine
thousand damson trees, and three thousand nine
hundred pear and apple trees, while there are
no fewer than two hundred and twenty-eight
thousand black-currant bushes.</p>


<h3>THE GRAPE AND PEACH IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p>The old saying about the inutility of carrying
coals to Newcastle receives a new rendering
in the fact that vine plants are being
brought from America to replenish the vineyards
of France, which have been in some
instances devastated by the phylloxera. Grapes
are now extensively grown in the United States
both for dessert and wine-making. A lady who
has recently been travelling in California, where
the grape family is wonderfully numerous, and
many of the vines exceptionally prolific, sometimes
obtaining a ‘luxuriance which sounds
almost incredible’—this lady—C. F. Gordon-Cumming—tells
us, among other facts, of bunches
of grapes which have been found to weigh as
high as fifty pounds! The vineyards of Colonel
Wilson, in the neighbourhood of the garden-city
of Los Angeles, cover two hundred and fifty acres
of ground, and the grapes yield one thousand
gallons of wine to the acre. In another vineyard,
there grow upwards of two hundred varieties of
grapes; and in the cellars of its proprietor are
stored two hundred thousand gallons of grape-juice,
ripening into wine, of which many kinds
are made in the state of California. Need it be
said that grapes in these regions are cheap—a
hatful can be purchased for a few cents! Only
think of the above-named Colonel Wilson having
‘two and a half million pounds of grapes, hung
up by their stalks, to keep them fresh for the
market’! That fine fruit, the peach, is equally
cheap in the peach-growing districts of the United
States. The annual value of the American peach-crop
is estimated at eleven and a half million
pounds sterling. In some seasons, peaches are so
abundant, that, to prevent their being lost, they
are used in immense quantities for the feeding of
pigs. Cannot this fruit be utilised for consumption
in Europe? Supplies of the fresh fruit
might be sent to us in the refrigerated chambers
of the steamboats.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="BOOK_GOSSIP">BOOK GOSSIP.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most interesting books of travel issued
of late years is that entitled, <i>Arminius Vambery:
His Life and Adventures</i> (London: T. Fisher
Unwin), which is now in the third edition. This
Hungarian traveller is a man of rare courage
and will, and possessed of high literary accomplishments;
and the narrative of his wanderings
in various capacities in Asia and Europe is told
with a graphic and picturesque power which is
extremely captivating.</p>

<p>Vambery, who was born in 1832, had a singularly
hard up-bringing, and the story of his early
years is quite as interesting as his later adventures
in foreign lands. His father died a few months
after the birth of the boy, leaving the family
in extremely poor circumstances. When he was
twelve years of age—up to which time, from lameness,
he could only walk with the help of a crutch—his
mother thought him old enough to shift for
himself. He had previously been three years
at school, where he had drawn attention upon
himself by his precocity. But the inexorable
poverty of his parent stood in the way of further
education, and at twelve he was apprenticed
to a ladies’ dressmaker, but only stayed long
enough in this employment to learn to stitch
two pieces of muslin together. He left the
shop of the ‘dress-artist,’ and did a little teaching
in the family of an innkeeper, ‘occasionally
waiting on thirsty guests.’ When he had saved
up eight florins, he hastened from the Island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">{208}</span>
of Schütt, where he had spent his years, to a
gymnasium in the vicinity of Pressburg, and here
began a strange struggle for existence and education.
His money was just sufficient to buy the
necessary books, and he had to depend on the
kindness and charity of others for his food.
Seven different families each gave him one day
in the week a free meal, adding to it something
for breakfast and luncheon; and he got the cast-off
clothes of the wealthier school-boys. Notwithstanding
all drawbacks, he made great progress
in his studies, and took a high place in the
Latin class—he was indeed able at fourteen years
of age to speak Latin with considerable fluency.
We cannot follow his career further, but can with
confidence commend the singular story of his life
and adventures to all readers, both young and
old.</p>

<p class="center">⁂</p>

<p>Literature and angling would seem to have
something in common. The number of books
that have been written on the ‘gentle art,’ and
that by men of striking ability, is too well
known to require enumeration. To this list we
must now add <i>Sprigs of Heather, or the Rambles
of ‘Mayfly’ with old Friends</i>, by the Rev. John
Anderson, D.D., Minister of Kinnoull. Mr
Anderson is a veteran angler, and is able to look
back to days spent by the river-side with the great
Christopher North, and with others who, though
of less note in the angling and literary world,
were still such as to afford to the author the
opportunity of telling many amusing and characteristic
stories regarding them. He is, as many,
perhaps most, anglers are, delighted with the
scenes of rural beauty into which his pursuits
have led him, and he describes them with the
pen of a ready and accomplished writer, and with
somewhat of poetic fervour. Mr Anderson is a
strong advocate of fly-fishing, and almost scornfully
speaks of those who use bait, as ‘ground-fishers,’
and the like. We are not sure but his
indignation on this point is misplaced, as all
bait-fishing is not done in muddy or discoloured
water, and perhaps as much skill is required to
fish successfully a small clear stream with worm
as with fly. Stewart and other well-known
anglers have long since acknowledged this. In
other respects, however, Mr Anderson’s little
volume is such that lovers of the rod and line
will find it entertaining reading.</p>

<p class="center">⁂</p>

<p>Those who love Scottish music and Scottish
dances will hail with pleasure the appearance
of two handsome volumes entitled, <i>The Athole
Collection of Dance Music of Scotland</i> (Edinburgh:
Maclachlan and Stewart). These volumes have
been compiled and arranged by Mr James Stewart
Robertson (Edradynate), who has done his work
in a most efficient manner. He, as an unprofessional
musician, apologises for having undertaken
such a work, which, he says, was only
done by him because he did not expect, from
the disfavour into which, for the present, Scottish
music and dances have unfortunately fallen,
that any professional musician, competent for
the task, ‘could be induced to devote the time,
and to run the chances attending the production
of such a work.’ So far as Mr Robertson’s execution
of the work is concerned, no such apology
was required; while his devotion to the task
which he has so satisfactorily accomplished renders
his services to his country almost patriotic. He
has selected his airs with admirable taste and
skill, and the two volumes contain within them
specimens of almost every characteristic of Scottish
dance music. No better or more acceptable
present could be sent from Scotch folks at home
to Scotch folks abroad than this <i>Athole Collection</i>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
